    <p>Hi! I'm Nathaniel Ellis.</p>
<body>
    <p> I'm a Cartographer. I'm  interested in all things maps, but I'm especially interested in abstract ways to reprsent natural or cultural phenomna. </p>

<p>Heres some of my work:</p>
    <p> Here is some of Americas largest rivers represented as trees. I used USGS discharge data to determine the width of the 
        "truck", "branches", "branchlets", "twigs" etc. I used cities with more than a quarter of a million people as the 
        leaves and lakes as the knots on the tree. That being said, I love the flexibility and the possibilities that someone 
        could take the idea of tree representation. One could use leaves and knots to represent dams, bridges or any natural 
        features or points of interests. Much of the choice will boil down to the individual river that is being represented. 
        I would likely of made different design choices if I drew a "knotty" Saint Lawerence instead of the "thick" Columbia, 
        "massive" Mississippi and "skinny" Colorado. It won 1st place in the Ptetnick Award in 2019.  </p>
    <p> The peice below was designed on telling the story of
        the Erie Canal in the twenty first century. It drew inspiration from story boards that were able to tell a
        succinct compelling story. It followed the traditional path of the Erie up the Hudson and across to
        Lake Erie. In choosing this set up, I wanted the story to flow as it did for people who originally used the
        canal to migrate. That being said, (once the history of the Erie was told), I attempted to transition into
        telling what the future could hold from Buffalo to Albany.  </p>
        
        Here I utilize Mapbox studies to do a take on an interactive “slippy” map inspired by forest fire
        prevention ‘propaganda” of the 70s. It utilized psychedelic colors and wonky fonts so that the user of
        the slippy map could see our world through the style of Smokey the Bear posters. I attempted to
        utilize the colors of one poster in particular (link to image) and made attempts to recreate the natural
        environment that we see in the forest images on the scale of the world. 
        <p> Below is a Choropleth map of commute time for New York City. I used census data and overlapped the Subway system. 
            I loved some of the trends that flew out of the census data (look at the Rockaways!) </p> 

        <p> Attached is my resume. Most of my recent work experience is as a wildland firefighter. I've had the pleasure of fighting fire
          in California, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Washington and Wyoming on handcrews and helitacks. </p>
